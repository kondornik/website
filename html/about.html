                <h3>What is SenseBot?</h3>
                <p>SenseBot (<a href="www.sensebot.net">www.sensebot.net</a>) represents a new type of Search Engine that delivers a summary in response to your search query instead of a collection of links to Web pages. SenseBot parses top results from the Web and prepares a text summary of them. The summary serves as a digest on the topic of your query, blending together the most significant and relevant aspects of the search results. The summary itself becomes the main result of your search. SenseBot's approach is unique and protected by Patent Pending. </p>

                <h3>What Technology do you use?</h3>
                <p>SenseBot is a <em>semantic</em> search engine, meaning that it attempts to understand what the result pages are about. It uses <em>text mining</em> to parse Web pages and identify their key semantic concepts. It then performs <em>multidocument summarization</em> of content to produce a coherent summary. You can read more about the approach in our interview to <a href="#">Search Engine Journal</a>. </p>

                <h3>Who is it for? Why should I use it?</h3>
                <p>Imagine you are not familiar with the concept of the <em>dot-com bubble</em>, and want to understand it. You type “dot-com bubble” into your favorite search engine and get back 10 links with some context around them. Alas, glancing over the context does not really give you a good idea of what the dot-com bubble was, or form an opinion on it. So you start clicking on the links, and soon realize that some of the pages presume that you are already familiar with the subject; others are too shallow; or biased; or just aggregate links to other resources instead of answering your question. By the time you finally understand what the dot-com bubble was, you’ve clicked on too many links and sifted through too much redundant information. Wouldn’t you rather click on one link and receive a concise summary, a digest on the phenomenon of the dot-com bubble, compiled from the top most relevant pages on the subject? Enter SenseBot, which does exactly that – generates a summary of the top pages returned by the search engine. After looking at the summary, you should be able to get a good idea about the dot-com bubble phenomenon, understand the dot-com model and notice a few key stages in it, and also see which of the sources about it are worthy should you decide to dig deeper. Note that SenseBot will drop the sources that are shallow on the content relevant to your topic – no matter how highly they were ranked by major search engines. You can see examples of such queries at our <a href="#">Samples page</a>.</p>
